Here is an R shiny app for exploring the effects of tuning certain parameters on single cell analysis clustering results. The data is from 1437 seed nuclei from [Picard et al 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-021-00922-0).  

Please wait ~30 seconds for the analysis to initialize with default parameters. Scroll to the bottom to view results. 

The analysis will re-run from whatever parameter you change. In general, the more upstream your edit, the longer the analysis will take. 

Gene and metadata plotting occurs instantaneously.   

Please use [TAIR](https://www.arabidopsis.org/index.jsp) identifiers for gene plotting only.
